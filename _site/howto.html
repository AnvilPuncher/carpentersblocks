            <h3>How To</h3>

Once a Carpenter's block is placed in the world, right-click it with any full-size block. If the block is compatible, it will become the cover block. This enables the Carpenter's block to mimic most of the donor block's properties including fire and explosion resistance, in addition to displaying it's texture.

Some Carpenter's blocks (including Block, Slope, and Stairs) support what are known as side covers. When a Carpenter's block has a cover, clicking any full and solid side will "stick" the block to the side.

Side covers can be customized independently from the host block, and can be removed from the host block by sneak left-clicking it with the Carpenter's Hammer.

... Customization, you say?

Have you ever wanted to see grass adorn blocks besides dirt? How about mycelium, hay, or snow toppers? These and others have been made available to you as overlays. The following images in the spoiler below will show you all the available overlays and which item is used to apply them. Simply hold the item in hand, and sneak right-click the Carpenter's block.

Remove overlays by sneak left-clicking the cover with the Carpenter's Hammer.

Let's explore your color options: take any of the vanilla dye powders, excluding bone meal, and sneak right-click the Carpenter's block. This will dye the block or side cover, depending on where you click. To retrieve the dye powder, sneak left-click the block or side cover with the Carpenter's Hammer.

Need more customization? Try chiseling designs into any Carpenter's block. Take your Carpenter's Chisel and left- or right-click any covered Carpenter's block. Left-clicking cycles backwards through patterns, and right-clicking cycles forwards.

Can I add my own chisel designs?

Of course! Open the mod's zip file and navigate to:

assets/carpentersblocks/textures/blocks/designs/chisel/

Simply drop your designs into the folder and they will automatically be available the next time you start the game. Be sure to check the "Extra" section in the download area for additional chisel design packs. If you'd like to submit your own work to be featured in the download area, don't hesitate to ask!

Now that we've explored the fundamentals behind customizing the blocks, I'll go into detail about some of the blocks that have unique functionality.

<dl>

   <dt>Carpenter's Barrier and Gate</dt>
      <dd>The Carpenter's Barrier will generate posts at intersections and corners automatically. You can force a post anywhere by left-clicking the barrier with the Carpenter's Hammer. A forced post will prevent connections to solid faces adjacent to the barrier.

You have several barrier types available; cycle through them by right-clicking the barrier with the Carpenter's Hammer. In addition, the vanilla-style barrier offers plank depth adjustments by sneak right-clicking the barrier.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Bed</dt>
      <dd>The Carpenter's Bed handles dye colors differently than the other blocks in this mod. To dye the frame of the bed, apply the dye to the head of the bed. To dye the default blanket color, apply the dye to the foot of the bed.

If that's too bland for your liking, let's explore bed designs. Left- or right-click the Carpenter's Bed with the Carpenter's Hammer to cycle backwards or forwards through a collection of custom bed designs. This will alter the pillow and blanket of the bed.

Can I add my own bed designs?

Of course! Open the mod's zip file and navigate to:

assets/carpentersblocks/textures/blocks/designs/bed/

In there, consult one of the template images to help you make your first design. Once done, simply drop your designs into the folder and they will automatically be available the next time you start the game.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Block and Creating Slabs</dt>
      <dd>To create a slab, you need the Carpenter's Block. To shape it into a slab, right click the block with the Carpenter's Hammer. The slab will form opposite of the side you hit. Alternatively, left-click the block with the Carpenter's Hammer to cycle through all slab orientations.

Carpenter's Blocks placed adjacent to the slab will match the neighboring slab type automatically, but won't necessarily be a continuation of the piece depending on orientation. Hold the sneak key while placing the block to override this behavior.

</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Button, Lever and Daylight Sensor</dt>
      <dd>Left-click any of these blocks with the Carpenter's Hammer to alter the redstone signal polarity.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Collapsible Block</dt>
      <dd>Right- or left-click any corner (or quadrant) of this block to lower or raise the quadrant. The top face of the block will generate slopes automatically.

The block will attempt to create smooth transitions with nearby blocks automatically. To prevent this behavior, hold the sneak key while placing the block.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Door and Hatch</dt>
      <dd>These blocks have several styles that you can choose from. Left- or right-click any part of the door or hatch with the Carpenter's Hammer to cycle through them.

Want the door to behave more like the vanilla iron door? Sneak right-click any part of the door or hatch to alter the behavior. The behaviors are straight-forward: behave like a wooden door, or behave like an iron door. Iron door behavior requires a redstone signal to open.

In addition, doors that should naturally open together will act as a single entity (i.e. double doors). Opening or closing either door will trigger both, and setting door behavior will apply to both doors automatically.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Flower Pot</dt>
      <dd>Formerly the Painter's Flower Pot, this block allows you to plant almost anything while retaining all the features of Carpenter's blocks.

Right click inside the pot to place soil. Flower pot components can now be removed in any order (except for soil if a plant is in pot). Sneak left-click the plant to remove it, or sneak left-click the cover to remove the cover. Soil cannot be removed unless the plant is removed first.

The old paint colors have been converted to designs. Left- or right-click the flower pot with the Carpenter's Hammer to cycle backwards or forwards through them. Sneak right-click with the hammer to clear the design. While the flower pot can support both covers and designs, it cannot support both simultaneously; if a cover exists, it will pop off when switching to a design.

As of version 3.0.0, certain plants can be fertilized. Right click the plant in the pot with bonemeal to fertilize it. Fertilization makes plants that are biome-colored take on a lively green color.

Can I add my own flower pot designs?

Of course! Open the mod's zip file and navigate to:

assets/carpentersblocks/textures/blocks/designs/flowerpot/

Simply drop your designs into the folder and they will automatically be available the next time you start the game.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Pressure Plate</dt>
      <dd>Left-click the pressure plate with the Carpenter's Hammer to alter the redstone signal polarity. Set whether you want it to emit a signal when stepped on, or whether you'd like to emit a signal only when nothing is on it.

Right-click the pressure plate with the Carpenter's Hammer to cycle through what type of entity should activate it. The types of entities include: players, animals, monsters, or all entities (including arrows and dropped items).</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Safe</dt>
      <dd>Right-click the safe with the Carpenter's Hammer to change automation permissions. This controls whether things like pipes can insert or extract items from the safe.

Sneak right-click the safe with the hammer to lock or unlock it. When unlocked, any player can access the contents of the safe. When locked, the light on the front will turn red, and only you or server operators will be able to access or destroy the safe. When unlocked, the light will turn green.

The blue light strip on the bottom-left side indicates the percentage of slots filled in the chest.

You can upgrade the safe's capacity by holding a gold ingot and right-clicking it. This will increase the capacity to 54 slots, similar to the vanilla double chest. The only way to get the gold ingot back is to destroy the chest.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Slope and Stairs</dt>
      <dd>Stairs will automatically orient themselves and form corners depending on where you click another block face. Wedge slopes will do the same.

Slopes have several types to choose from. While holding a slope, cycle between them by holding sneak and scrolling up or down on your mouse wheel. Top-facing prism slopes will connect to each other automatically.

If auto-building functionality is making block placement difficult, hold the sneak key while placing the block to prevent this behavior.

You can also manually cycle through stair and slope types and directions after block placement by left- or right-clicking them with the Carpenter's Hammer.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Tile</dt>
      <dd>While holding the Carpenter's Hammer, sneak left-click tiles to remove them. Left- or right-click them with the hammer to move backwards or forwards through designs. Sneak right-click them with the hammer to rotate their designs.

You can dye tiles by right-clicking them with any of the 16 available dyes. Bonemeal will strip the tile of it's dye properties.

The tile was inspired by Kaevator's Wallpaper mod, and is not designed to mimic blocks in the game, but instead offers users the opportunity to easily load their own designs into the game to be used as "tiles," or wallpapers by dragging the image files into the zip file under:

assets/carpentersblocks/textures/blocks/designs/tile

If you'd like to use Kaevator's original wallpapers with tiles, I've provided a separate package in the "Extra" section in the download area.</dd>
      
   <dt>Carpenter's Torch</dt>
      <dd>When exposed to rain, and not protected by a block above, the torch will randomly extinguish by first smoldering and eventually burning out. The torch will relight itself after the weather lifts and it has a chance to dry.

Alternatively, you can relight torches immediately by right-clicking them with another torch.</dd>
