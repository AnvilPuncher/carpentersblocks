<h3>Migrating 1.6.X worlds to 1.7.X</h3>

<p>To migrate your Carpenter's Blocks 1.6.4 worlds to 1.7.2, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Load Carpenter's Blocks v2.1.2 or later for MC 1.6+ into your mods folder in the 1.6.4 subdirectory.</li>
   <li>Load Carpenter's Blocks v3.2.0 or later for MC 1.7+ into your mods folder in the 1.7.2 subdirectory.</li>
   <li>Start the game in Minecraft 1.6.4 and load the world.</li>
   <li>Ensure ALL chunks with Carpenter's Blocks have been loaded into memory by visiting all locations where the blocks are used.</li>
   <li>Exit game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blocks should now be prepared for migration. Start the game in Minecraft 1.7.2 and load the world. Note: run the latest recommended version of Forge for 1.7.2 to ensure you don't run into problems.</p>

<p>What won't survive the migration:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Placed doors and beds will disappear, so be sure to destroy them first.</li>
   <li>Chisel patterns and designs will disappear from placed blocks.</li>
</ul>
